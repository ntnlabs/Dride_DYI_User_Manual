# How do I know the Dride is not working
## The light is not stable white
- The light is red :: check microSD card
- The light is green  only :: -> recommend to use the **What to do to make it work** approach
- The light is white and green :: -> recommend to use the **What to do to make it work** approach
- No light at all :: No power

## After poweroff (by pullingthe charger from lighter, or by turning off the car) the unit will continoue to work for more  than 15 seconds
- Hard to solve, wait for it to turn off, then  plug it back in. Depending of the light use the **The light is not stable white** approach.

# What to do to make it work
- Hold the share button until the red light turns on (approx. 10 secs, the red light is not really visible) and then release
- Dride will reboot (red light and green (??? don't remember, maybe white) oscilate)
- Dride will start to record at predeffined settings
- After reboot, there is a big chance that You can connect with the app (don't try it if You don't need it - wifi should connect by itself)
