# Howto setup the Dridecam for the first time

- Select microSD card: size: 16GB or more
- Format microSD card (FAT32)
- Insert microSD card
- Power on the device
- Light :: green
- Light :: white
- Open app
- Connect to wifi (name: dride...., pass: ilovedride) (this may disconnect Your regular internet connection)
- Add device
- Setup resolution and file-timesize
- Get a regular internet connection back
- Login do Dride account

# Share button
- short press will preserve actual footage with approx. 30 secs before and 30 secs after the push
- long press (10 secs) will reset the device to factory settings (light will flash red and then the device will reboot)
           **OR** this will reset just the wireless name & password. Data from oficial forum are inconclusive.

# Sharing a video
- The app downloads all "shared" videos to phone in the background.
- When the videos are downloaded, the app will notify user to upload videos to Dride page.

*(or so I heard, never got this to work)*

# Reset with a PIN
- gently push the button inside the small hole next to the microSD card slot for 1 second. Dunno if unit needs to be powered on or off, **assuming** it needs to be powered on.

# Lights
- Red: problems with microSD card
- Green: System is on
- White: Recording
