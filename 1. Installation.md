# General notes

- Stick Dascam to the upper center point of front windshield. The Dashcam should not block the view of the driver.
- (!IMPORTANT) Be sure to position the Dashcam so that You can easily insert or takeout the SD cam.
- Be sure to position the Dashcam so that You can access the reset hole.

# Rear Dashcam

- The two wires (black and red) are not used. I recommend You isolate the wires from each other and stove it away.
- Use the sticky wireholders on rear cam.
