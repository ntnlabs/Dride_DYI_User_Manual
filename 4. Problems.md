# time

**How it works**\
The Dashcam gets date/time from app thru wifi. If wifi is not avaliable it may cause the date/time to desync. *(my guess)*

**The problem**\
The time on video is sometimes not correct (like [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191104-070712.png)).

**Solution:**\
none so far (firmware 1.1 beta 2 looks promising)

# not recording

**How it works**\
After start of the Dashcam the Dride should start recording (microSD card present and formatted).

**The problem**\
The unit is not recording. In app there are no videos visible, ot videos have no thumbnail (like [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191104-070632.png)).

**Solution:**\
none so far

# messed up recording

**How it works**\
After start of the Dashcam the Dride should start recording in predefined files cycling according to the setup (microSD card present and formatted).

**The problem**\
The unit is saving files every second (like [here](./app_screenshots/tiny_files.png)).

**Solution:**\
Reset the device, connect the wifi,  do not open the app.  (firmware 1.1 beta 2 looks promising)

# app design

**How it works**\
Design should not break user experience.

**The problem**\
The app should not break user experience, like text outside screen that cannot be seen, or design that overlaps over the video (like [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191024-065643.png) or [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191026-175641.png)).

**Solution:**\
none so far  (app ver. v5.9.2 looks okay)
