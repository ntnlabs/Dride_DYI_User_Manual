# time

**How it works**
The Dashcam gets date/time from app thru wifi. If wifi is not avaliable it may cause the date/time to desync. *(my guess)*

**The problem**
The time on video is sometimes not correct (like [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191104-070712.png)).

**Solution:**
none so far

# not recording

**How it works**
After start of the Dashcam the Dride should start recording (microSD card present and formatted).

**The problem**
The unit is not recording. In app there are no videos visible, ot videos have no thumbnail (like [here](./app_screenshots/Screenshot_20191104-070632.png)).

**Solution:**
none so far
